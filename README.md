# 🎵 Flying Lyrics
[cite_start]**Lyrics that follow you wherever you go.** Flying Lyrics is a browser extension that pulls your music lyrics into a floating window so you can sing along while browsing other tabs or working in different apps[cite: 1]. No more switching back and forth to check the words!

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 The "Always-on-Top" Player
* [cite_start]**Floating Window:** Watch your lyrics in a small, resizable window that stays on top of everything else on your screen[cite: 1].
* [cite_start]**Spotify & YouTube Music:** It works perfectly with both the Spotify Web Player and YouTube Music[cite: 2].
* [cite_start]**No Setup Required:** The app automatically finds and downloads the right lyrics for your song as soon as you hit play[cite: 3].

### 🌍 Read & Understand Everything
* [cite_start]**Triple-Layer View:** See the original lyrics, the romanization (supporting **Japanese, Korean, or Mandarin**), and the translation into your language—all at the same time[cite: 4].
* [cite_start]**Instant Translation:** If a song doesn't have a translation, the app uses Google Translate to create one for you on the fly[cite: 5].
* [cite_start]**Perfect Fit:** The text automatically resizes and wraps so it never looks messy or overlaps, no matter how you stretch the window[cite: 6].
* [cite_start]**Cinematic Feel:** The current line glows and stays in focus, while the rest of the lyrics fade out slightly so you always know where you are[cite: 7].

### 🎨 Beautiful & Adaptive Design
* [cite_start]**Matching Colors:** The window looks at your song's album art and changes its colors to match the "vibe" of the music[cite: 8, 9].
* [cite_start]**Crystal Clear:** Special shadows and brightness adjustments make sure the text is always easy to read, even against bright or busy album covers[cite: 10].

### 🕹️ Full Control at Your Fingertips
* [cite_start]**Built-in Buttons:** Pause, skip, or scrub through the song using the seeker bar directly inside the floating window[cite: 11, 12].
* [cite_start]**Quick Toggles:** Instantly mute the music or turn the translated lyrics on and off with a single click[cite: 13, 14].
* [cite_start]**Jump Back:** One click takes you straight back to the original music tab, even if it's buried under ten other windows[cite: 15].

### ⚙️ Personalize Your Experience
* [cite_start]**Quick-Access Popup:** Manage all your settings by clicking the Flying Lyrics icon in your browser's extension menu. [cite: 16]
* [cite_start]**Pick Your Language:** Use the dropdown menu in the popup to choose your preferred translation language (e.g., Indonesian, English). [cite: 17]
* [cite_start]**Fix the Timing:** If the lyrics are a little bit too fast or slow, use the Sync Offset buttons to perfectly line them up. [cite: 18]
* [cite_start]**Smart Memory:** The extension automatically remembers your timing fixes for every song, so you only ever have to fix it once! [cite: 19]

## ⚠️ Known Limitations & Tips

* **Spotify Connection:** Occasionally, the seeker bar might act a bit strange or the lyrics might stop rolling when using the Spotify Web Player. Fuck you Spotify 🖕🖕🖕🖕
* **Translation Speed:** Because the app uses a free version of the Google Translate API to keep the extension free for everyone, lyrics might take an extra second or two to load when translating.
* **API Protection:** To keep things running smoothly, try not to toggle the translation on and off too rapidly. Switching it too often might cause the Google Translate API to temporarily block requests.
